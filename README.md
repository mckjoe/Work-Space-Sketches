## Process

* Research: Browse websites for companies that seem to have similar values to The Space.  Think about how their designs and aesthetics communicate their personalities.  Consider color schemes, typography, pairing fonts, and general aesthetics.  For the sake of this assignment I will find two or three websites that I like and try to unpack what I get from their layouts and aesthetics.

    1. Wieden and Kennedy.  Wieden + Kennedy's website was surprisingly minimal.  I am sure that is part of what their design plan was, but I was pretty surprised and felt like that stood in contrast to the work that they do for other companies, which usually seems to be more original and unique.  The color scheme is incredibly simple - just black, gray, and white with splashes of orange.  The website makes me feel like the company has a large focus on the people who work there, the clients they work with, and the quality and originality in the projects they create.  The lack of color and distractions and the overall uniformity make it very easy to focus on these things, and the layout emphasizes this by giving you options to navigate to their pages and sections in multiple different ways.  There is a navbar that essentially routes you to the same places as when you scroll through the homepage looking at the different sections and options.  The images of their work space makes it clear that they are proud of their work environments and amenities and the images of the art supplies and cool creations make it obvious that there is an emphasis on creativity and freedom in the projects they work on.  It seems like they think outside of the box while maintaining a focused and professional image of themselves.

    2.  My Masterpiece Art Studio (MMAS).  MMAS appears to be a company that provides artists with a fun and inviting space to work, and families and individuals can also go and take classes or sign up for camps or to receive instruction or direction from other artists.  Their website does a really nice job using minimal coloring with off-white, orange, and green and some textures to help add some depth to the page.  The website is aesthetically pleasing and makes me feel like the studio is probably clean and well organized.  They seem to run a professional environment for any old person to pop into and take advantage of their facilities or resources.  The webpage uses engaging language with descriptions like "create fun, fabulous, imaginative masterpieces" and the font and typography are all very legible.  The company feels professional but fun and creative and inviting.
