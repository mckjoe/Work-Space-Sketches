## Process

* Research: Browse websites for companies that seem to have similar values to The Space.  Think about how their designs and aesthetics communicate their personalities.  Consider color schemes, typography, pairing fonts, and general aesthetics.  For the sake of this assignment I will find two or three websites that I like and try to unpack what I get from their layouts and aesthetics.
